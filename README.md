# Libra-Decison-Matrix
Python Script that contains the conditional functions that make the decision.
**Explicit Language Warning**
This script uses a random number generator that just elects an options.
The key thing is that in running the program once, one is supposed to reflection on the decision that was given to them.
Once something is actually picked, the user should take their reaction into account and actually make a decision.
